## How to Run the Project

1. The project can be started from the terminal with the following command: mvn clean javafx:run

2. Buttons with predefined scenarios have been added for easier testing. Each button has a hint to clarify the scenario:
  - Button 1: Uses the input data from the task.
  - Button 2: Contains invalid data for parsing.
  - Button 3: Contains additional data to realistically display information in the table.
  - Button 4: Points to a file that does not exist.

## Notes
I would have written tests for the program, but at the current stage, I don't see a benefit from it. 
There are also some aspects that I believe can be optimized and improved, such as reusing buttons and visual components.
